# Reducing-the-Size-of-the-Lattice-using-K-Means

The most powerful and adaptable subfield of post-quantum
encryption has come to be known as lattice-based cryptography.
Traditional cryptographic systems, including RSA and DSA, are
predicated on ideas like the supposed intractability of the discrete and
prime number difficulties with logarithms. However, these presumptions
are threatened by the introduction of quantum computing. To overcome
this obstacle, lattice-based as a reliable solution, cryptography has grown
in popularity. In this cryptographic paradigm, one of the major obstacles
is the problem of the shortest vector (SVP). This paper focuses on
addressing approaches to lattice issues, especially in two-dimensional up
to four-dimensional spaces. In order to do this, we use the K-means
machine learning (ML) technique. In this paper, findings and analyses
show that the strategy we've suggested can reach an accuracy of 60% on
datasets that we have prepared ourselves. This study offers a contribution
to enhancing lattice-based cryptographyâ€™s security against emerging
threats, especially in the quantum computing context.
